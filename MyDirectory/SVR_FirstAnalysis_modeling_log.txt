The scikit-learn (sklearn)-based Python workflow independently supports both modeling (i.e., training and testing) and prediction (i.e., using a pre-built model), and implements 5 feature selection methods, 19 model regressors, hyperparameter tuning, performance metric computation, feature and permutation importance analyses, prediction interval estimation, execution monitoring via progress bars, and parallel processing.

The traceback level was set to 0
The warnings were ignored
The recommended versions of Python and packages were properly controlled
The modeling subcommand was used
The provided sample limit per dataset (i.e., 10) meets or exceeds the recommended minimum (i.e., 10), which is expected to support more reliable performance metrics
The phenotype in the input file of phenotypes was properly transformed as numeric (i.e., the second column)
The minimum required number of samples in the training/testing datasets (i.e., >= 20) and the expected number of columns (i.e., >= 3) in the input file of mutations were properly controlled (i.e., 200 and 11, respectively)
The minimum required number of samples in the training/testing datasets (i.e., >= 20) and the expected number of columns (i.e., = 3) in the input file of phenotypes were properly controlled (i.e., 200 and 3, respectively)
The absence of missing phenotypes in the input file of phenotypes was properly controlled (i.e., the second column)
The expected datasets (i.e., 'training' or 'testing') in the input file of phenotypes were properly controlled (i.e., the third column)
The sorted sample identifiers were confirmed as identical between the input files of mutations and phenotypes/datasets
The provided selection of training/testing datasets (i.e., manual) and percentage of random splitting (i.e., None) were compatible
The provided selection of training/testing datasets (i.e., manual) and number of quantiles (i.e., None) were compatible
The training and testing datasets were constructed based on the 'manual' setting
The Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic was computed to compare the distributions of phenotypes in the training and testing datasets: 0.05 (p-value: 0.999994)
The number of samples in the training (i.e., 160) and testing (i.e., 40) datasets was properly controlled to be higher than, or equal to, the set limit (i.e., 10)
The input tested mutations include all features required by the trained one-hot encoder
The input tested mutations contain no unexpected features for one-hot encoding
The encoded features between training and testing datasets were confirmed as identical
The one-hot encoded column order was harmonized across training and testing datasets to ensure deterministic feature alignment for feature selection and modeling
The 10 provided features were one-hot encoded into 80 encoded features
The provided feature selection method was properly recognized: SelectKBest (SKB)
The provided regressor was properly recognized: support vector regression (SVR)
The pipeline components were properly recognized: Pipeline(steps=[('feature_selection', SelectKBest(score_func=functools.partial(<function mutual_info_regression at 0x7fa17cfdc4a0>, random_state=42))), ('model', SVR())])
The provided tuning parameters were properly recognized: [{'feature_selection__k': [25, 50], 'feature_selection__score_func': [<function mutual_info_regression at 0x7fa17cfdc4a0>], 'model__kernel': ['linear', 'rbf', 'poly'], 'model__C': [1.0, 10], 'model__gamma': ['scale', 0.01], 'model__degree': [2, 3], 'model__tol': [0.0001], 'model__max_iter': [-1], 'model__epsilon': [0.1]}]
The cross-validation setting implied: 9 distinct parameter names, 15 parameter value options, 48 parameter combinations, and 240 fits during cross-validation
The tqdm_joblib progress bars are activated when using two or more jobs
The best parameters during model cross-validation were: {'feature_selection__k': 50, 'feature_selection__score_func': <function mutual_info_regression at 0x7fa17cfdc4a0>, 'model__C': 10, 'model__degree': 2, 'model__epsilon': 0.1, 'model__gamma': 'scale', 'model__kernel': 'rbf', 'model__max_iter': -1, 'model__tol': 0.0001}
The best negative root mean squared error during model cross-validation was: -2.71528
The pipeline potentially selected and used 50 one-hot encoded features to train the model
The one-hot encoded feature names were recovered before feature selection
The selected regressor did not expose feature importances natively (NaN placeholder (no native importance for rbf kernel SVR))
The permutation importance was requested (i.e., True) but the number of repetitions was not set (i.e., False); the default value is therefore used (i.e., 10)
The permutation importance was restricted to the features selected upstream (i.e., 50) by the specified feature selection method
The permutation importance was successfully computed on both training and testing datasets
The prediction intervals (i.e., 95.0%) were calculated using ResidualQuantileWrapper with alpha = 0.05
The output directory already existed

Note: NaN placeholder in case no native or detectable feature importance is available. 
Note: Boosting models, especially histogram-based gradient boosting (HGB), may yield all-zero feature importances when no meaningful split gains are computed—typically due to strong regularization, shallow trees, or low feature variability.
