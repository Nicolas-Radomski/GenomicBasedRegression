# used only to modify laSFM behavior

# used only to modify enSFM behavior
#'feature_selection__threshold': [-float('inf')], # rank features by importance

# used only to modify ExtraTreesRegressor behavior
# simplified tuning used together with SKB
'model__n_estimators': [100], # enough trees for stable variance reduction
'model__max_depth': [None], # allow full depth; ET rarely overfits due to random splits
'model__min_samples_split': [2], # default; deeper trees improve performance on noisy data
'model__min_samples_leaf': [1], # default; ET handles variance well
'model__max_features': ['sqrt'], # strong feature randomness, faster and robust
'model__bootstrap': [False], # ET normally uses the entire dataset without bootstrapping

# --- Model tuning (ExtraTreesRegressor) ---
# used only to modify ExtraTreesRegressor behavior
